        Hi! I am Jessica, a undergraduate student studying Computer Engineering at the University of British Columbia.<br />
        <br />
        I am an amiable team-player that is very eager to learn about new skills and whatever that's out there!<br />

Currently I am still working on trying to figure out what concentration my degree would be leading to. I have experiences with Java, C++, C, Verilog (a hardware description language) and have worked more on the back-end and low-level side with these languages. Currently playing around with HTML/CSS!
