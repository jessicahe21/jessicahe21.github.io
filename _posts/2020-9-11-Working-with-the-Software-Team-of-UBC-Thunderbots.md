title: Building Soccer-Playing Robots
---

<blockquote>
<i><a href="https://www.ubcthunderbots.ca/">UBC Thunderbots</a> is an engineering student design team that designs and creates competitive robots to compete in the Small Size League of the international Robocup Federation.</i>

Between 2018 to 2020, I joined the Software Team of Thunderbots as a junior member that was completely new to the C++ language and, well, everything robotics! The Software Team is in charge of developing the Artificial Intelligence of our soccer-playing robots. I was very enthusiastic to learn and develop the skillset needed in order to contribute.<br />

I worked hard to catch up on the language on my own time as well as how to use the tools and simulators that my team utilized. Throughout my time there, I collaborated with my team members through Agile workflow and I learned etiquettes for code version control such as code review using GitHub. Of course, none of this could have been accomplished without the senior team members' mentorship and patience. (Really, thanks a whole bunch!)<br />
<br /> 
The team's main focus of that year was a complete rewrite of our old code base. As a junior member, I implemented decision making and control evaluation functions in C++ that improved robotsâ€™ gameplay mechanisms. Thunderbots achieved first place in the 6v6 league of the 2019 Robocup competition, and I could not be prouder of everybody's hardwork!<br />
