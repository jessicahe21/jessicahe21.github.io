<b><p style="font-size:22px">Hello, I am Jessica!</p></b>
I am an undergraduate student studying Computer Engineering at the University of British Columbia. Eager to learn and explore new things, very friendly and team-based. (Also loves cats.) Welcome to my website and portfolio! 😊<br />
<br />
My pronouns are she/her, and I am a part of the <a href="https://queercoded.ca/">Queer Coded</a> community at UBC. 🏳️‍🌈<br />
<br />
Here you can find some of the projects I have worked on in the past as well as what I learned from them. <i>(Some sections are still under renovation; More projects to be added soon!)</i><br />
